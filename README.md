# FRC Robot Testing

This is a repo where I am teaching myself some of the particulars of FRC robot testing

## Stuff I want to try:
- Path Planning
- Swerve Drive profiling

## Stuff I tried successfully:

- Localisation using lime light
- using limelight for auto aim

## Stuff I tred unsuccessfully:
- building auto aim using the limelight in its own command

## Recomended VS Code IDE Extensions
- JsonMeezilla.json
