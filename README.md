# FRC Robot Testing

This is a repo where I am teaching myself some of the particulars of FRC robot testing

## Stuff I want to try:
- Path Planning
- Lime light auto aim
- Swerve Drive profiling

## Stuff I tried successfully:
- CTRE Swerve code generation
- Localisation using lime light

## Stuff I tred unsuccessfully:
- Nothing so far, but Ive got a small sample size. Well see how this goes.
