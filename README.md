# FRC Robot Testing

This is a repo where I am teaching myself some of the particulars of FRC robot testing

## Stuff I want to try:
- Path Planning
- Swerve Drive profiling

## Stuff I tried successfully:
- CTRE Swerve code generation
- Localization using lime light
- using limelight for auto aim
- building limelight auto aim into its own command
    - this was funky, see comments inside commands/AimAtSpeaker.java

## Stuff I tried unsuccessfully:
- Everything has worked so far, I guess I need to make things more challenging .-.
